        <h2>How does lived experience relate to social identities and vary through time and place.</h2>
        <p>Lived experience in relation to social identities varies significantly through time and place, shaped by social norms and history. 
            In the late 20th century U.S., white identity was often not considered racialized, as white people were viewed as neutral or invisible, 
            leaving many white individuals unaware of their racial privilege (Color of Fear). And discussions about race often brought out feelings of 
            guilt and shame among white people who spoke about race, particularly when confronting the advantages afforded to them by systemic inequalities 
            (Michael & Bartoli, 2022). Beliefs in colorblindness and meritocracy, especially among the privileged, further reinforced this unawareness, 
            fostering the view that everyone had equal opportunities regardless of race. In contrast, Brazilâ€™s racial dynamics are more fluid, with social factors like wealth, 
            status, and personal appearance playing a significant role in how race is perceived (Stuber). Globally, the concept of race is recognized in only a few countries, 
            most of which have a history of racial stratification, while European countries like France often emphasize ethnicity and claim to be "colorblind" (Stuber). 
            The way race has been officially categorized has also evolved, with the U.S. historically using fractional classifications of African ancestry, such as "quadroon" 
            and "octoroon" prior to 1930. Additionally, racial privilege in the U.S. was starkly evident in housing policies, with white people receiving 98% of home 
            loans for three decades, further entrenching racial inequities.</p>
